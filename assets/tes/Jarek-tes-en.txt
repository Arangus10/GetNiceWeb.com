I highly recommend working with Bartek!
He guided me through the entire process of creating the website, from choosing the Layout to choosing the right photos for the website. All changes and my suggestions were introduced expressly and the time of creating the website was very pleasant. Bartek was always ready for consultations, adapting to me, which was crucial for me when running my own business.
The finished product is more than satisfactory for me.
I am planning another business project and I will definitely use his services as well!
